      <h2>About the Artist</h2>
      <p>
        Rising from the streets of Ikeja but with a distinctly French flair, rapper and singer Venoe lays his introspective rhymes atop melodic sounds with songs like <em>Ganjah Man</em> and <em>Goddamn</em>, resulting in a hybrid form that has captured the ears of regions past the reach of his street. The artist who used to go by the name <strong>PercoTheJet</strong> released a track called <em>Suicide</em> which didnâ€™t perform well internationally but did locally. Now known as <strong>Venoe</strong>, he is ready to take music seriously.
